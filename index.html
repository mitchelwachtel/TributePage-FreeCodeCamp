        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p class="odd_Q">
          There is one good thing about reaching the bottom. When you get there,
          there's nothing left to do but fight your way back up or die.
        </p>
        <p class="even_Q">
          I've got to be happy with myself when this ride is over.
        </p>
        <p class="odd_Q">
          I couldn't change by myself. I needed my faith and belief in Christ to
          give me the strength to break free and allow people to help me to
          change.
        </p>
        <p class="even_Q">
          To me, wrestling is therapy. No matter how bad my personal situation
          is, when I step into the ring, all my troubles disappear. My baggage
          stays in the back where it belongs.
        </p>
        <p class="odd_Q">I lie, I cheat, and I steal.</p>
        <p class="even_Q">
          The twenty minutes or more we spend inside the ring, that's the fun
          part. It's the rest of our lives that's the real battle - the ruthless
          backstage politics, the constant traveling, the endless mental and
          physical aches and pains.
